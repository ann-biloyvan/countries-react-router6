# About the project

This is a single page application that fetches data about countries from a third-party rest api. The app was developed using React 18. It includes 3 pages, created with React Router v6:

1. main page with the iteractive list of all countries;
2. details page that provides more information on a chosen by a user country;
3. not found page which is shown as a user tries to search a non-existing country or page on this website.

There's also a switcher to change color theme, which stores it's state within the app.
